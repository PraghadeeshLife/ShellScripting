Shell Programming Notes - 1

# Indicates Single Line Comment

#!/bin/sh -> Indicates which shell to run such as csh, bash, tch, etc

C Program Working
In C Programming, the .c files is a high level file where it is compiled with the help of compiler and provides a binary which is generally of the extension .out,
which is used to execute and generate the results.

Shell Program Working
In Shell Programming, the .sh file is treated like a normal text file though it contains an .sh extenstion. The Shell file needs to be given an executable permission
to run it for the first time, where it can be provided using the chmod command. The program by itself contains the binary files, for example the ls command, grep command,
cp command point to the Binary File present in the bin directory. So, the shell program doesn't contain any specific compiler and it functions moreover like an interpretor.

C               |  Shell
printf("Hello") | echo "Hello World"
scanf()         | read


C Programming Contains the datatypes, but whereas in Shell Programming there is no such concept called datatypes.

C Programming requires variables declaration and intialization, whereas Shell Programming doesn't require declaration. One can use it directly.

C Programming contains Header Files whereas the Shell Programming doesn't contain Header files.

C Programming has it entry point as main() function, but Shell Programming doesn't contain main() and it just executes the program from the starting line.

C Program Lifecycle
Write a Program -> Compile for Binaries -> Run -> Modify the Program -> Compile again to modify the Binaries -> Run

Shell Program Lifecycle
Write a Program - Modify the Permission to execute using chmod for the first time -> Run -> Modify -> Run
